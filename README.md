# StellarNet 🚀

StellarNet is a hackathon project that combines a Python-based machine learning API with a browser-based front-end for interactive exploration. Users can interact with the model via a web interface, while the backend API handles computations and data processing.

## 🔹 Features

- **Interactive Front-End**: Accessible through `index.html` in your browser.
- **Backend API**: Python API (Flask) for data processing and model inference.
- **Machine Learning**: Powered by PyTorch for fast and efficient computations.
- **Cross-Origin Support**: `flask-cors` enabled for seamless front-end and API communication.
- **Dockerized**: Run everything with a single Docker command—no Python setup required.
