# StellarNet - Hunt for Exoplanets with AI!

StellarNet is project for the NASA Space Apps 2025 Hackathon that combines a PyTorch machine learning model with a browser-based front-end for interactive exploration. Users can interact with the model via a web interface, while the backend API handles computations and data processing. Users can look at previously discovered Exoplanets, or upload data themselves! The data used is called flux data, and can be collected by amateur astronomers.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Front-End**: Accessible through `index.html` in your browser.
- **Backend API**: Python API (Flask) for data processing and model inference.
- **Machine Learning**: Powered by PyTorch for fast and efficient computations.
- **Flask Intergration**: `flask-cors` enabled for seamless front-end and API communication.
- **Dockerized**: Run everything with a single Docker command‚Äîno Python setup required.
